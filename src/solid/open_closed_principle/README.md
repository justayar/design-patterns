## Explanation

The Open-Closed Principle requires that classes should be open for extension and closed to modification.

## Pros

- More readable and maintainable code
- Open for extensions, closed for modifications
- Easy to add new functionalities without breaking existing functionality

## Cons

- The code will be complex to create many subclasses and interface if it is needed.
- Potential for over-engineering, leading to too much abstraction and unnecessary code.
