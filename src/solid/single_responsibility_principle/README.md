## Explanation

Single Responsibility is a principle states that a class should do one thing, and therefore it should have only a single reason to change.

## Pros

- More readable and maintainable code
- Easy to test
- Changes on class requires less effort

## Cons

- The code will be complex to create many subclasses and interface if it is needed.
- Potential for over-engineering, leading to too much abstraction and unnecessary code.
